<p2>Welcome to my journey! I will be sharing my experiences as I navigate my entire way throughout the process
of moving up in the technical industry! Hoepfully, my triumphs and accomplishments will inspire someone
to just get up and make the change!</p2><br>

<p3>Often times, we hear "IT, tech, computer sciences, engineer, etc." and think that this field requires rocket
science. It doesn't! It can be very demanding and challenging but we are all capable and all it takes is effort!
I started on the technical support side of things and then worked my way up into data analyzing but there was 
something missing.....PASSION! While internet technology and computer sciences can be a very lucrative industry,
it's equally as important to have a passion for what you do! My passion is creating! I was born to be a creator!
Therefore, I decided that change was neccessary and I'm now making positive choices in alignment with my end-goal!</p3><br>
<br>

<p4>Now, here I am! I've reached some goals but am soo far from done! A few years ago, I'd never think that I'd be
back in school with 4 kids, let alone not studying Computer Sciences with everything on my plate! Nor did I see
engineering in my future! But like I said, here I am! I made it this far! I'm back in school finishing my bachelor's degree
in computer science with 4 kids! And on top of that, I'm an engineering Apprentice too! I have to admit, it 
really feels great to write some future goals down, work towards them and then watch everything play out just as you
visioned!</p4><br><br>

<p5>So, here's what I did. I have been provided business consultation services for a years as well as operating a graphic
design business. But I wanted to do more and of course, I wanted more money. So, I did my research. I took quizzes. I
wanted to find out where my spot was in this here life. I discovered that there certainly was more money to do exactly
what I love doing! I decided that I wanted to be able to offer more services as a digital marketer. Perhaps, if I could
also learn how to build websites from scratch and develop apps along with my grahphic design skills that I'd be on to
something! Trust the road to discovery was exhausting! I spent several years stuck not knowing which way to turn because
I have many skills and wasn't quite sure where to invest them. But, once I decided on software engineering, I got the 
ball rolling! I was adamant, determined and extremely resillient throughout the process!</p5><br><br>

<p6>I put together a plan, I like to call it my millionaire blueprint :). I gathered all the tools that I would need for 
maximum success in this field and exactly sorted all the steps that it would take to get there. Also, I had a plan A, B,
D, E, F, and G....haha you get the picture. When I say that I had it figured out, I mean just that! Plan A was enrolling
into a FREE bootcamp or a bootcamp that I could receive a full scholarship for. Hence, me discovering Per Scholas! 
Part of that plan was to receive all the knowledge neccessary for mastering the basics of programming. Then, I planned
to acheive more certifications to specialize in my craft. If Per Scholas did not accept me, I was ready to self-teach myself
everything therr was to know! Surprisingly, I started doing that before the program began anyways. It was important
that I took initiative because in my head, the clock is rolling, and I have goals to meet in a short time! My goal 
was to be in the field by summer. I believed that if I put a realistic deadline on my goals, then it would impel me 
to push harder! And it did!</p6><br><br>

<p7>Anyways, I made it to round 2! The first day of my apprenticeship is tomorrow! Let's recap some highlights! I had a 
passion for creating and decided to pursue this career to be able to develop websites and apps! Well, look what we 
have here....my very first website built completely from scratch with the help of Per Scholas beautiful instruction!
I am also in an apprenticeship and a University student again! I did it! But, I have ways to go still! Point, is
the only thing that can hold you back is you! Go after your goals no matter how big or small and if you put forth 
full effort, things can and will happen for you even when it seems like a reach!</p7><br><br>

<p8>I'm so exicted about my first day tomorrow and I'm looking forward to learning everything that I can! I'll be asking plenty
of questions, hopefully, that's just the kind of student that I've always been and I hope not to offend anyone! 
Throughout this journey, I'll be sharing the good the bad and everything in between....2022 Let's goooo!!!!!!</p8>
